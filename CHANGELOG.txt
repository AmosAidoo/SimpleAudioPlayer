Todo: 		1. Create a thread for AddToPlaylist method to prevent program from freezing when adding many files (over 500) to the playlist.
		2. Use wxFileConfig to save settings instead of the registry.
		3. Incorporate all linux codes into the program and hence, add conditional compilation codes so that the same code
		 will compile everywhere.
		4. create MakeFiles for the project.
		5. Derive a separate class for wxTimer.
		5. Use a cross-platform library to decode audio (Preferrably libVlc or bass)
